# UNDER CONSTRUCTION
Some changes are being made to this site, some things may move around or temporarily go missing
# NAME CHANGED
This site is now avaliable under an1nterestingname.github.io instead of someguynamedjj.github.io. Some parts of this site may not have changed to reflect this.
# Welcome to my website!
Welcome to my website, here you will find all of my social links, YouTube videos, Twitch Streams and posts where I talk about future content, or just what I'm doing at the moment. I'll also put anything that I make avaliable to download avaliable on here as well. Also, the website is hosted on GitHub, so you can find the Source Code on the Links page as well.
# Navigation
Until I can make a side/top bar on the site, you can find every page here:
