# Welcome to my website!
Welcome to my website, here you will find all of my social links, YouTube videos, Twitch Streams and posts where I talk about future content, or just what I'm doing at the moment. I'll also put anything that I make avaliable to download avaliable on here as well. Also, the website is hosted on GitHub, so you can find the Source Code on the Links page as well.
# About Me
Hi, I'm SomeGuyNamedJJ, or just JJ and I am a small Minecraft YouTuber and Twitch Streamer. I am also a Linux user and I run EndeavourOS, a distro baased on Arch dualbooted with Windows 11. I should also warn you that I am Bri'ish and I know way too much about obscure things and Minecraft Commands.
