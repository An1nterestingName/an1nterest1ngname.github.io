# Links
This is the links page, where you can find all of the useful links for things I do.
# YouTube
I have two YouTube channels, my main one where I post regular, edited content and my second one where I post things like Stream VODS from my Twitch and extra content of some description.

# Twitch
I sometimes stream over on Twitch, I do lots of different things there so I would recommend leaving a follow. Also, if you log into the Streamlabs Link with Twitch, you get access to my version of Channel Points, called Great Bri'ish Pounds since I do not have Affiliate so I can't use Twitch's normal points.

# PlanetMinecraft
I upload most of my maps to PlanetMinecraft, but you will always be able to find more downloads here.

# Discord
I don't have a Discord Server at the moment, but if you see me on any Discord servers under the name someguynamedjj, feel free to say hi, but don't DM me unless you need to.
# GitHub (Source Code)
I host this site on GitHub using GitHub Pages and Jekyll, if you would like to see the code for this site, you can look at the Repo and maybe even submit a pull request to fix some of my extremely wierd code for the bits that use code.
